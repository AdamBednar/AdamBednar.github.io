      <em>Kahan S. Dhillon Jr.</em>, 37, a stocky man with a neatly trimmed beard and wearing a black pin-striped suit and a black turban, arrived at <a href = "http://www.thecapitalgrille.com/locations/md/baltimore/baltimore/8023"> Capital Grille </a> on Pratt Street in downtown Baltimore with a joke prepared.
    </p>
<p>
  It was a muggy July afternoon, and Dhillon, a Sikh, was quick to quip about the heat and the turban making it worse. The joke, and one other made during an hour-long interview, were tossed off nonchalantly, as if second nature to a man who regularly feels the need to put at ease people not familiar with his faith.
</p>
<p>
  But in Dhillon’s case it’s not his headwear that’s drawing attention in Baltimore. It’s the <strong>$10 billion</strong> in investment he claims he can bring to the city that’s turning heads.
</p>
<em>“Right now, Baltimore is at the bottom of the barrel.<br/> It’s time to get it to being at the top, it’s time to get it to where it’s potential is, which is at the front of the line … <br/> I always like to say it took a lot for Baltimore to get where it is now, and it’s going to take a lot more to get it out,”<br/> — Dhillon said.</em>
